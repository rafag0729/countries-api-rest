# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

The challenge is to integrate the app with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

For this challenge was used ReactJS library [React](https://reactjs.org)

The users are able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

This challenge was great, because it allowed me to work with fetch, state, customHooks, effects, mobile and desktop design Sass and more functions for modifying and preparing info to be showed
